# Non-Functional Requirements for Task Management System

## 1. Performance

- The system should respond to API requests within 500ms under normal operating conditions.
- The frontend application should load the main dashboard within 2 seconds on a standard broadband connection.
- The system should support at least 100 concurrent users without significant degradation in response time.
- Bulk operations (e.g., batch task creation or updates) should be processed efficiently and not cause timeouts.

## 2. Security

- All data transmission between client and server must use HTTPS.
- User passwords must be hashed and salted using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., bcrypt or Argon2).
- JWT tokens must be securely generated, signed, and validated for all protected endpoints.
- The system must implement input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other common vulnerabilities.
- The system must enforce rate limiting and account lockout policies to mitigate brute-force attacks.
- Sensitive user data (e.g., passwords, reset tokens) must never be logged or exposed in error messages.

## 3. Scalability

- The backend must be designed to support horizontal scaling (e.g., stateless API servers, database connection pooling).
- The database must be able to handle growth in the number of users and tasks without significant performance loss.
- The system should support deployment in cloud environments and be compatible with containerization (e.g., Docker).
- The architecture should allow for easy addition of new features and integration with third-party services.

## 4. Usability

- The user interface must be intuitive and accessible, following established UX/UI best practices.
- The system must provide clear feedback for user actions (e.g., success, error, loading states).
- The application must be responsive and usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Error messages must be user-friendly and provide actionable guidance.
- The system must support accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1) to ensure use by people with disabilities.

These non-functional requirements ensure the Task Management System is robust, secure, scalable, and user-friendly, providing a high-quality experience for all users.
