# Functional Requirements for Task Management API

## 1. Authentication & Authorization

### 1.1 User Registration

- The API must allow new users to register with a unique email and password.
- Passwords must be securely hashed before storage.
- The API must validate email format and enforce password strength requirements (minimum length, character types).

### 1.2 User Login

- The API must allow users to log in with their email and password.
- Upon successful login, the API must return a JWT (JSON Web Token) for authenticated requests.
- The API must validate credentials and return appropriate error messages for invalid login attempts.

### 1.3 Protected Endpoints

- All task management endpoints must require a valid JWT.
- The API must reject requests to protected endpoints without a valid or expired token.

### 1.4 Password Reset

- The API must provide a mechanism for users to request a password reset (e.g., via email link or token).
- The API must allow users to set a new password using a valid reset token.

## 2. Task Management

### 2.1 Create Task

- The API must allow authenticated users to create a new task with the following fields:
  - Title (required, string, max 255 chars)
  - Description (optional, string)
  - Priority (required, enum: Low, Medium, High)
  - Due Date (optional, ISO 8601 date)
  - Status (default: Incomplete)
- The API must validate all required fields and return errors for invalid input.

### 2.2 Read Tasks

- The API must allow users to retrieve a list of their own tasks.
- The API must support filtering by status, priority, and due date range.
- The API must support searching tasks by keyword in title or description.
- The API must allow users to retrieve details of a specific task by ID.

### 2.3 Update Task

- The API must allow users to update any field of their own tasks.
- The API must validate updated fields and reject invalid data.
- The API must not allow users to update tasks they do not own.

### 2.4 Delete Task

- The API must allow users to delete their own tasks by ID.
- The API must not allow users to delete tasks they do not own.

### 2.5 Mark Task as Complete/Incomplete

- The API must allow users to mark a task as complete or incomplete.
- The API must update the task status accordingly.

## 3. Data Validation & Error Handling

- All endpoints must validate input data and return clear error messages for invalid or missing fields.
- The API must return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 422).
- The API must handle and log unexpected errors without exposing sensitive information.

## 4. Security Requirements

- All sensitive data (passwords, tokens) must be securely stored and transmitted over HTTPS.
- The API must implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
- The API must sanitize all inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
