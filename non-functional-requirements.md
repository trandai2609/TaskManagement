# Task Management System - Non-Functional Requirements

## 1. Performance
- The system shall respond to 95% of API requests within 1 second under normal load.
- The system shall support at least 1,000 concurrent users without significant degradation in response time.
- Page load times for the web interface shall not exceed 2 seconds for 95% of requests.
- Background jobs (e.g., notifications, reminders) shall be processed within 1 minute of their scheduled time.
- The system shall support real-time updates for task changes using WebSockets or similar technology.

## 2. Security
- All data in transit shall be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
- All sensitive data at rest (e.g., passwords, tokens) shall be encrypted using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., bcrypt for passwords).
- The system shall implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to resources based on user roles.
- The system shall protect against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection) through input validation and sanitization.
- The system shall enforce strong password policies (minimum 8 characters, complexity requirements).
- The system shall log all authentication attempts and security-relevant events for audit purposes.
- The system shall implement rate limiting on authentication and sensitive endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks.
- The system shall support multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.

## 3. Scalability
- The system shall be designed to scale horizontally to handle increased load by adding more servers or containers.
- The database shall support sharding or partitioning to accommodate large volumes of task and user data.
- The system shall use caching strategies (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to reduce database load and improve response times.
- The system shall support stateless API endpoints to facilitate load balancing and scaling.
- The system shall be deployable in cloud environments and support auto-scaling features.
- The system shall be able to handle at least a 10x increase in user base and data volume without major architectural changes.

## 4. Usability
- The user interface shall be intuitive and require no more than 2 clicks to access any primary feature (e.g., create, edit, delete task).
- The system shall provide clear error messages and guidance for user actions.
- The system shall be accessible to users with disabilities, meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- The system shall support responsive design for use on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- The system shall provide onboarding and help documentation for new users.
- The system shall support localization and internationalization for multiple languages.
- The system shall provide keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

## 5. Availability & Reliability
- The system shall have an uptime of 99.9% over any 30-day period.
- The system shall provide automated daily backups and support point-in-time recovery.
- The system shall gracefully handle server or service failures and provide meaningful error messages to users.
- The system shall support disaster recovery procedures with a recovery time objective (RTO) of 4 hours and a recovery point objective (RPO) of 1 hour.

## 6. Maintainability
- The system codebase shall follow industry best practices for readability, modularity, and documentation.
- The system shall provide automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) covering at least 80% of the codebase.
- The system shall support zero-downtime deployments for updates and patches.
- The system shall provide monitoring and alerting for key performance and error metrics.
